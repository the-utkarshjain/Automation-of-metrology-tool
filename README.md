# Automation-of-metrology-tool
Winter Intern at ISRO

My responsibility as an intern was to completely automate the process of data
submission on DMIS to enhance the efficiency of the fab. This involved fetching
the data spit by the metrology equipment and then parsing it to extract necessary information which later is uploaded on the main database. This data holds
importance in later stages of fabrication where it is used for process control and
tool health monitoring.

<b>Note:</b> Actual files cannot be shared due to security reasons but some of the implementation can be found at the end of internship report.
